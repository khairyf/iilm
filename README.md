To use iilm, run iilm.py.\
Run security.py microservice to enable login encrypting.

Login credentials (with encryption) is optional, for simple testing. To disable login credentials, delete lines 25-49 in iilm.py.
With logins, a client and server public + private key must be generated through a Python library, ZeroMQ. To generate this, run "generate_credentials.py."
